## About Skur

Skur gives you weather information about places in norway.
It uses one API to lookup latitude/longtitude for a given
place in Norway, and another API to look up current weather
information about this place (based on lat/long).

The word "skur" can be a synonym to Yr, and it can also be
a place to provide shelter.
